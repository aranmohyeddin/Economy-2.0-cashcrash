1. Ecosystem: GSER
 * Global Startup Ecosystem Report 2019

2. Paradigm: ICO
 * We can turn complicated contracts and derivatives into smart contracts.
 * Buy tuicCoin with Ethereum

3. Paradigm: ICO, smart contract
 * Periodic Referendums
   + On-chain
   + Two third, majority
   + Weighted on investment
   + Fulfillment of responsibilities
     - Yes? pay next instalment.
     - No? payback to investors.

4. Paradigm: ICO, The early bird catches the worm
 * Anyone
 * Any size
 * Any time
 * In or out

5. Paradigm: ICO, a business model
 * Reserve some tokens for the team in the genesis block.
 * The creator of BTC has a net worth twice TRUMP, 6 at its peak.

6. Shared economy: The problem
 * Monopoly and market manipulation
 * The Second Mouse Gets the Cheese

7. Shared economy: The solution
 * Taxi drivers don't care about monopoly
 * Numnumerous micro-transactions

8. Shared economy: The market
 * Homestay broking
 * Authenticity and Integrity of user reviews

9. Shared economy: Carchain, the modules
 * Off-chain membership service provider(MSP)
 * Off-chain matchmakers

10. Shared economy: Carchain, the process
 * User sends a transaction to three matchmakers
 * Matchmakers offer matchings to drivers with a fee
 * Drivers put their price on each offer
 * User chooses between final offers
 * Driver pays MSP and matchmaker fees
 * User pays the driver how they wish

11. Smart grid, The problem
 * Prosumerism, production by consumers
 * Price is dictated in Iran
 * Developed countries have Electricity Exchanges and more sophisticated pricing

12. Smart grid, The solution, modules
 * Blockchain smart meters.
 * Measure and predict electricity production and usage
 * Generate tokens based on predictions
 * The owner of this token can consume xKW electricity between these timestamps

13. Smart grid, The solution, process
 * Consumers buy these tokens
 * Meters take in electricity so far as the owner has valid tokens.
 * Automatic scheduling of energy-intensive tasks

14. Smart grid, Advantages
 * Volatile electricity price
 * Elimination of peak hours
 * Much more efficient power grid

15. Pricing, Tokens as an equity security
 * Blockchain makes pricing easy
 * Ghoghnus

16. Pricing, Ghoghnus
 * Liquidating fixed assets.
 * A new token for each asset
 * Exchangeable with Peyman
 * Payman is exchangeable with gold

17. Pricing, Every entity an IPO
 * Decentralized IPO for every asset
 * Blockchain Smart grid was also taking advantage of this idea

18. Pricing, Prediction market
 * Trading the outcome of events
 * Open market price represents the public perception of probabilities
 * Easy to implement using smart contracts
 * Yes/No tokens for the answer to a question
 * Smart contract divides the money among winners

19. Distributed platforms
 * Storj: A distributed storage platform
 * 90 pages whitepaper, Travelport was 14.
 * How to trust your money in the hands of the thieves.
 * Chop and RAID
 * Enigma: A distributed computation platform

20. Review
 * BTC and blockchain capacity
 * ETH, the virtual machine of smart contracts
 * Permissioned blockchains and B$ startups
 * ICO, to Scam or not to scam, that is the question
 * Every entity, an IPO, pricing electricity and fixed assets
 * Prediction markets, trading the outcome
 * Storj and Enigma, learning how to trust.

21. Thanks
 * Thanks to everyone for your time
 * Thank you, Sara, for the slides
 * Thank you Mahdi, Tarlan, and Mahtab for arranging all this
 * Thank you Alaleh, Bamdad, and Rayan for your great Pecha Kucha
 * Thank you Nashid for getting us together
